Tool for monitoring Israeli ROBLOX users.

    Due to Israel's education system, a large majority of it's citizens are extremists, and this is
    something that causes users to grow up to be terrorists, the average Israeli citizen has likely played
    ROBLOX at least once, and due to the effect of ROBLOX a platform used for underaged gambling and
    e-dating for children, we can monitor possible future-terrorist activities.

    The NSA uses similar methods on their persons of interest, meaning that by example, this is completely
    morally okay to do.

    All Israeli citizens are obligated to join the IDF (A terrorist organization) at 18 (or 21 depending on
    circumstance) meaning almost every user monitored with this tool is likely to become a future terrorist.
